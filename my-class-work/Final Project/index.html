    		<h2>Best Way of Marketing</h2>
    			<p>Gaining coverage in local papers, trade magazines and websites can greatly increase name recognition and educate people about your business  driving new customer acquisition.  While many growing businesses in competitive landscapes may want to hire an expensive public relations firm, startups and small businesses can start off with some simple “do it yourself” PR.
				Start by researching publications and writers that cover your industry -- or local business.  Once you have a grasp on the writers you want to reach and the stories they typically write for their publication, craft a pitch around your business that will pique their interest.  
				For example, if you’re in the widget business, explain how your widget business is impacting the local economy -- or your industry. Entrepreneurs and small business owners can also subscribe to Help a Reporter Out. This free service provides queries for upcoming articles  allowing you to contact the writer directly.</p>
